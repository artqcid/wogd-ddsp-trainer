# wogd-ddsp-trainer - Bug Ledger

_This is the **single source of truth** for all bugs in the project. A bug is
recorded in full **exactly once, here**. Every other document (implementation
plans, `log.md`) references bugs only by `BUG-<id>`._

## Rules (non-redundancy)

1. A bug is described in full **only** in this file.
2. `BUG-<id>` IDs are assigned **only** here, by incrementing `next_id` below.
3. Implementation plans keep a `## BUGS` section that lists **references only**
   (`BUG-<id>` + one-line + status), never the full record.
4. One bug = one owner milestone (the phase where it is rooted); cross-phase
   impacts are listed as `affected:` milestones on the same entry, not
   duplicated.

## Counter

`next_id: 1`

## Bug template (copy for each new bug)

```markdown
## BUG-<id> - <one-line title>
- status: open | in-progress | fixed | verified
- milestone: <owner milestone, e.g. M2>
- affected: <other milestones, optional>
- found-in: <step / commit / context>
- severity: <critical | major | minor>
- description: ...
- reproduction: ...
- resolution: <filled when fixed>
- history: <append-only, newest first>
```
