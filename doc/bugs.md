# wogd-ddsp-trainer - Bug Ledger

_This is the **single source of truth** for all bugs in the project. A bug is
recorded in full **exactly once, here**. Every other document (implementation
plans, `log.md`) references bugs only by `BUG-<id>`._

## Rules (non-redundancy)

1. A bug is described in full **only** in this file.
2. `BUG-<id>` IDs are assigned **only** here, by incrementing `next_id` below.
3. Implementation plans keep a `## BUGS` section that lists **references only**
   (`BUG-<id>` + one-line + status), never the full record.
4. One bug = one owner milestone (the phase where it is rooted); cross-phase
   impacts are listed as `affected:` milestones on the same entry, not
   duplicated.

## Counter

`next_id: 2`

## Bug template (copy for each new bug)

```markdown
## BUG-<id> - <one-line title>
- status: open | in-progress | fixed | verified
- milestone: <owner milestone, e.g. M2>
- affected: <other milestones, optional>
- found-in: <step / commit / context>
- severity: <critical | major | minor>
- description: ...
- reproduction: ...
- resolution: <filled when fixed>
- history: <append-only, newest first>
```

## Open bugs

## BUG-1 - neutone_sdk pinned numpy<2.3 has no cp314 Windows wheel (py3.14)
- status: open
- milestone: M3 (export, M3.4)
- affected: M1.2
- found-in: M1.2 dependency install
- severity: major
- description: `neutone_sdk` (1.5.2) requires `numpy<2.3.0,>=1.21.6`. On Python
  3.14/Windows, numpy 2.2.x has NO cp314 wheel on PyPI (only an sdist), so pip
  attempts a Meson/source build which fails (`sccache clang cannot compile`);
  `neutone_sdk` cannot be installed into the current 3.14+cu130 environment.
  Additionally its metadata lists `License: LGPL` + an `Other/Proprietary`
  classifier — the OSI status must be verified before adoption.
- reproduction: `pip install neutone_sdk` on `.venv` (py3.14) -> build error.
- resolution: (open) Deferred to M3.4. Reintroduce once a numpy-cp314-compatible
  `neutone_sdk` release exists, or plan M3.4 export around TorchScript/ONNX
  directly if the license is not OSI-approved.
- history:
  - 2026-08-31 — recorded; neutone_sdk removed from M1 core deps
    (pyproject.toml comment + M1.2 note + `../oss-dependencies.md`).

## Fixed bugs

_None yet._
